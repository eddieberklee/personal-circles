personal-circles
================

Circles and flat version of my new personal-site.

To push to the live website just "git push website master"

Plan: "Create individually unique pop-ups for each of my portfolio items."
  * Get screenshots of my projects.
  * Place them in a class to be displayed when they're clicked.
  * Find some way to implement the "clicking on each portfolio item".
